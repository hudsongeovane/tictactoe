This project is an implementation of the tic-tac-toe game, with a Min-Max Tree AI.

The game was developed using React.

## Running Game

If you want to test the game, see https://hudsongeovane.github.io/tictactoe/


## Artificial Intelligence

As we have only 9 possible moves at all, we can go deep in the min-max tree and get only optimal moves.
